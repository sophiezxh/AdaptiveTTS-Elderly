path/to/wav|1|And has you slain him?|1
path/to/wav|10|That I am a born nurse.|1

path/to/wav|8|The name really is the aged aged man.|1
path/to/wav|10|The name of the song is called haddocks.|1

path/to/wav|6|It's part of my secret.|1
path/to/wav|8|How do you like you dirty bird!|1
path/to/wav|9|His large mouth curled into a sneer.|1

path/to/wav|5|A whirring noise was heard.|2
path/to/wav|10|The eye could not catch them.|2
path/to/wav|7|I'll send for Tom to my boudoir.|2
path/to/wav|3|A lady, is on Alice's lap!|2
path/to/wav|10|Six was half way down the room.|2

path/to/wav|8|I'm as bad as I can be.|0
path/to/wav|2|I smell the breath of an English.|0
path/to/wav|5|Clear are your eyes and bright your breath!|0
path/to/wav|4|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.|0
path/to/wav|2|Give me your hand or I will cry harder than before.|0
path/to/wav|10|Chapter eleven on the doorstep.|0
path/to/wav|10|Alice I won't forget it again.|0
path/to/wav|3|But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.|0
path/to/wav|4|They are made of wood.|0
path/to/wav|10|In which piglet meets a elephant.|0
path/to/wav|7|As rich-as Peter's son in law!|0
path/to/wav|9|Let's make the noise a snake.|0
path/to/wav|1|In my opinion that is a good idea!|0
path/to/wav|6|However, somebody killed something.|0
path/to/wav|1|Your midget wife can never sing a song.|0
path/to/wav|1|And has you slain him?|0
path/to/wav|10|That I am a born nurse.|0
path/to/wav|9|The new born baby is stolen as we go.|0
path/to/wav|8|We nightly dance our heyday guise.|0
path/to/wav|4|The new born baby is stolen as we go.|0
path/to/wav|5|Ask god to help you.|0
path/to/wav|4|It's to say how you do with Tom's answer.|0
path/to/wav|10|This is Jack, the relatives of Tom.|0
path/to/wav|3|The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs.|0
path/to/wav|3|A voice said: Come in.|0
path/to/wav|6|Lucy, a clever farmer.|0
path/to/wav|4|What are you waiting for? man.|0
path/to/wav|10|He likes dragons very much.|0
path/to/wav|9|So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.|0
path/to/wav|9|Hold up my chin, slow and solid.|0
path/to/wav|5|I shall say good bye.|0
path/to/wav|2|The ladybug told them proudly.|0
path/to/wav|1|And they were sandy yellow brownish all over.|0
path/to/wav|9|And on the top of them, came Winnie, the cute bear.|0
path/to/wav|7|I know you .|0
path/to/wav|4|I say neither yea nor nay.|0
path/to/wav|4|Toast from the bread fruit tree.|0

path/to/wav|4|Why did I wake up!|0
path/to/wav|8|Paul's teeth ached because of lemon.|0
path/to/wav|9|The squire himself showed perfect.|0
path/to/wav|3|And what are doves. And what are doves.|0
path/to/wav|4|From August eighteenth, of their divorce.|0
path/to/wav|10|As rich as Peter's son in law!|0
path/to/wav|6|And I never had a whooping cough why.|0
path/to/wav|8|The name really is the aged aged man.|0
path/to/wav|10|The name of the song is called haddocks.|0
path/to/wav|7|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.|0
path/to/wav|3|All smile were real and the happier，the more sincere .|0
path/to/wav|6|Fear neither root nor sprout!|0
path/to/wav|4|Reed by the living pool!|0

path/to/wav|8|They are made of wood.|0
path/to/wav|8|And be with you,Tom!|0
path/to/wav|1|please excuse me.|0
path/to/wav|6|Tom could hardly speak for laughing.|0
path/to/wav|10|This used to be Jerry's occupation.|0

path/to/wav|9|Confess that you opened the thirteenth door.|0
path/to/wav|8|But I saw you walking.|0
path/to/wav|9|What do you think of this question?|0
path/to/wav|5|Zero four three a silver shilling is journey.|0
path/to/wav|7|Can your name be more hilarious?|0
path/to/wav|7|If not, I shall go no further.|0

path/to/wav|9|She just smiled calmly, mother knows that is the best smile.|0
path/to/wav|7|Clear are your eyes and bright your breath!|0
path/to/wav|8|I say I will be emperor.|0
path/to/wav|3|That I owe my thanks to you.|0

path/to/wav|4|I say I will be emperor.|0
path/to/wav|4|What an impetuous boy he is!|0
path/to/wav|5|The song is called Ways and Means.|0
path/to/wav|9|And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail.|0
path/to/wav|6|It's part of my secret.|0
path/to/wav|8|How do you like you dirty bird!|0
path/to/wav|9|His large mouth curled into a sneer.|0
path/to/wav|8|He searched through the box.|0
path/to/wav|4|She has a high voice.|0

path/to/wav|5|Clear than clear water!|0
path/to/wav|6|Her kind and firm glance.|0
path/to/wav|4|Your own wife is not at home.|0

path/to/wav|10|That was his chief thought.|0
path/to/wav|3|This is Jack, the relatives of Tom.|0
path/to/wav|6|Midyear is day, shire year.|0

path/to/wav|6|The first year they sowed rye.|0
path/to/wav|8|Her paw went into your eye?|0
path/to/David's lips were twitching?|0
path/to/wav|1|Cuckoos is downheaded and cry.|0
path/to/wav|8|She has a high voice.|0
path/to/wav|9|Toast from the bread fruit tree.|0
path/to/wav|3|Cuckoos is downheaded and crying.|0
path/to/have two to fetch and carry.|0

path/to/wav|4|But I saw you walking.|0
path/to/wav|5|that sounds good.|0
path/to/wav|4|No thank you.|0

path/to/wav|7|From each cake, there sprang a huge dog.|0
path/to/wav|5|Lucy, a clever farmer.|0
path/to/wav|2|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.|0
path/to/wav|9|They ate beef at the butcher shop.|0

path/to/wav|7|This used to be Jerry's occupation.|0
path/to/wav|2|She has felt shy of it.|0
